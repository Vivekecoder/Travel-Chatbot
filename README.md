This project is a travel-focused chatbot named GlobeGuru built using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the Streamlit framework. Here's a detailed explanation of its components and functionality:

**üîç How It Works**
User Interaction:
Users enter queries into the chat interface.
The chatbot processes input and matches it with the closest intent.
Response Generation:
Machine learning models predict the intent.
Responses are fetched dynamically from the intents.json file.
Model Training:
Data from intents.json is preprocessed using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier are used for training.
Chat History Logging:
Conversations are saved in chat_log.csv for future analysis.

**üöÄ Features**
**Interactive Chat Interface:**
Dynamic responses to user queries.
Real-time chat history display.
**Travel Assistance:**
Covers topics like destinations, budgeting, and travel tips.
Provides recommendations and general advice.
**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate chatbot performance with metrics like accuracy and classification reports.
**Chat History Management:**
Logs conversations for reference and analysis.
**Customizable Design:**
Built with Streamlit and custom CSS for an engaging user interface.
